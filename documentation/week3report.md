# Week 3 Report

Unfortunately this week I did not have as much time to work on the project as I would've liked. This means I did not get all that I wanted to get done this week. I did however use the time that I had to make very good progress on the valid move generator.

I decided to use bitboards to represent the board state, as this allows for more efficient move generation and checks but also I thought in some cases not using bitboards could've make the coding a bit more annoying. I was able to do this as I think I have a good grasp of bit manipulation so it all seemed very clear to me. I only have to finish up the move generation for the king and then I should be able to put it all together and have a working move generator that I can test to make sure it works correctly.

Next week I will have to spend a bit more time on the project as I want to finish up the move generation and test it (very quick), create at least a basic heuristic function, and implement the minimax algorithm. This is so that when the first set of code reviews starts after next week, whoever is reviewing my code should be able to actually play the bot on lichess and see how it performs.


Time spent this week: 7 hours
