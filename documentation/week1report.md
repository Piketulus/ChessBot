# Week 1 Report

This week I chose my topic and started familiarizing myself with existing game repository that is to be used for this project. It took a while but I am fairly certain I now know where and how to start producing my own code for my AI next week. I created my own repository, set up Codecov for it, and registered it on Labtool. Finally, I wrote the project specification document.

I did some learning on Chess AI's and heuristics to gain insight into how I could implement my AI. As an avid chess player myself, I will probably try to come up with my own original heuristics for position evaluation to see what I can come up with, but depending on the success I may resort to using research and knowledge from the internet.

While familiarizing myself with the project base, I tried running the test bot on Lichess and Xboard to get an idea of how the project is run. Playing against the computer on Lichess worked as expected, but for some reason I could not get it to work with Xboard. I am not sure what the issue is, but I thought perhaps the code doesn't work with the newest version of Xboard pre-installed on the school laptop and tried installing the version given in the documentation but did not manage to compile the older version of Xboard. 

I will try again in the following weeks to get my project to work with Xboard, but if not possible at least it works with Lichess, which is already enough.

Starting next week, first I will most likely try to get some sort of heuristic evaluator and representation of the chess board done, which I can then use in a minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make a first version of the AI using some standard library datastructures. Then I can work on implementing the datastructures myself and improving my heuristic to make my AI stronger.


Time spent this week: 7 hours
