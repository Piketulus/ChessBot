# Week 2 Report

This week I did a lot of thinking and started coding my project. As with any project that involves multiple classes and files, it is important to have an idea of the structure of the project in order to implement it well without having to make major changes later due to oversight. So I made sure to take my time to first think about what are the parts that I need before I start making anything. 

The first thing I wanted to implement was the representation of the chessboard itself. I created the classes Piece, MoveParser, and ChessBoard to accomplish this. I also created unit tests for these classes to make sure the methods and classes worked as intented. This was important to do right away as with this project, I won't really be able to personally test that anything works as intended until it is all mostly done and I am actually able to run the bot in Lichess or Xboard. (Test results can be viewed after building the project, in the reports folder in the build directory, and code coverage is linked at the top of the README)

I thought I may be able to start work on the move generator that gets all valid moves given a board position this week as well, but that involved some hours of planning, thinking, figuring out, and research as it is a somewhat complex task and I want it to be done somewhat efficiently in order to eventually end up with a decent bot. Therefore, my goal for next week will be to implement the move generator and test that it works perfectly. 


Time spent this week: 10 hours
